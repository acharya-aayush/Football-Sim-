### 🛠️ **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:**

*   **[SYSTEM] Advanced Data Validation Framework:** Created `comprehensive_data_check.py` with:
    * Multi-layer validation for leagues, clubs, players, managers
    * Cross-reference integrity checking
    * Intelligent club ID matching for variations
    * Comprehensive reporting system

*   **[SYSTEM] Automated Backup Management:** Implemented throughout all scripts:
    * Timestamped backups for every file modification
    * Version control for data integrity fixes
    * Recovery system for rollback capabilities

*   **[SYSTEM] Smart Error Handling:** Enhanced all scripts with:
    * Robust JSON parsing for malformed files
    * UTF-8 encoding support across all operations
    * Graceful failure handling with detailed logging

*   **[MAJOR] Serie B & Ligue 2 Complete Integration (May 26, 2025):** Successfully expanded the football simulation database with complete second-tier Italian and French divisions:
    * **Serie B (Italian Second Division):** Added all 20 clubs with complete rosters (600 players total, 85% Italian nationality)
    * **Ligue 2 (French Second Division):** Added all 18 clubs with complete rosters (540 players total, 80% French nationality)
    * **Manager Coverage:** Generated 38 new managers with realistic Italian/French names and appropriate second-division skill levels
    * **League Configuration:** Proper tier 2 setup with promotion/relegation mechanics, realistic reputation scores, and prize money structures
    * **File Organization:** Established dedicated directories following existing patterns (`league_ita_serieb_clubs_players/`, `league_fra_ligue2_clubs_players/`)
    * **Verification Tools:** Created comprehensive verification scripts to ensure data integrity across all new leagues

*   **[FEATURE] League-Specific Player Generation (May 23, 2025):** Enhanced the player generation system to create more realistic squad compositions:
    * Implemented detailed nationality distributions for each league in `club_player_generations.py`
    * EPL: 60% English with mix of French, Spanish, German, Brazilian, and Argentine players
    * La Liga: 60% Spanish with significant Argentine and Brazilian presence
    * Serie A: 55% Italian with strong South American representation
    * Bundesliga: 60% German with Austrian, French, Dutch, and Polish players
    * Ligue 1: 60% French with significant African player presence (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Algeria, etc.)
    * Serie B: 85% Italian with remaining 15% international (realistic second division distribution)
    * Ligue 2: 80% French with 20% international players (Africans, other Europeans)
    * Created extensive name databases for each nationality to generate authentic player names

*   **[FEATURE] Player Regeneration System (May 23, 2025):** Developed `regenerate_players.py` script that:
    * Can refresh player data for entire leagues while maintaining proper nationality distributions
    * Identifies existing player files by club ID and regenerates them with updated logic
    * Preserves the structure and authenticity of squad compositions
    * Provides a foundation for implementing future transfer windows and new season transitions

*   **[DATA STRATEGY] Hybrid Player Creation Approach (May 19, 2025):** After hitting API rate limits and data quality issues, decided on a hybrid approach: manually create accurate player data for top 10 clubs in major leagues, and generate realistic fictional players for remaining clubs. This gives better control over player quality and consistency while still populating the football world with thousands of players. Removed all API-fetched data from `epl_club_players` directory.

*   **[FEATURE] Auto Starting XI Generator (May 19, 2025):** Added `generate_starting_xi.py` script that automatically:
    * Scans all club player files in the `data/clubs_players` directory
    * Matches clubs with their managers from `data/managers.json`
    * Uses the manager's preferred formation to create an optimal starting XI for each team
    * Displays the results sorted by overall team rating
    * Shows position suitability indicators (* for primary position, + for secondary, ~ for makeshift)
    * No manual updates needed when adding new club player files

*   **[FEATURE] Player Attribute Scaling (May 19, 2025):** Implemented normalization of all player attributes (technical, mental, physical, GK, hidden attributes like injury proneness, consistency, etc.) and `potential_ability_range` to a unified 0-100 scale within `update_current_ability.py`. This includes the calculation and scaling of `current_ability`. A `--scale` command-line argument was added to trigger this comprehensive scaling process across all player files.
*   **[FEATURE] Enhanced Starting XI Selection (May 19, 2025):** Significantly overhauled the `starting_XI_Selection.py` script.
    *   The selection process now prioritizes players based on their `current_ability` and their effectiveness in specific positions (primary, secondary, or makeshift roles, determined by an adaptability factor).
    *   A sophisticated refinement step has been introduced. After an initial greedy selection, the system iteratively evaluates 2-player swaps within the chosen XI. If swapping two players\' positions results in a higher combined effective ability for those two slots, the swap is executed. This loop continues until no further improvements can be made, aiming for an optimal team composition.
    *   The output now clearly displays the selected players in a standard formation order (GK, Defenders, Midfielders, Attackers), showing each player\'s name, their assigned position in the XI, and their `current_ability`.
*   **[FIX] Player Data Integrity & Normalization (May 19, 2025):** Added robust mechanisms within `update_current_ability.py` to:
    *   Detect if attributes have already been scaled to prevent them from exceeding the 0-100 range on subsequent script runs.
    *   Correct `potential_ability_range` values that might become invalid (e.g., min > max, or negative values) after normalization, ensuring data consistency.
*   **[FIX] JSON Parsing Robustness (May 18-19, 2025):** Iteratively improved the JSON parsing logic in `update_current_ability.py` to more reliably handle files with comments and slightly malformed JSON structures. This included implementing specific workarounds for problematic files like `club_arsenal.json` to ensure successful data extraction.
*   **[FIX] Encoding Errors in XI Selection (May 18, 2025):** Resolved `UnicodeDecodeError` encountered when reading player and manager files in `starting_XI_Selection.py` by explicitly setting `encoding=\'utf-8\'`.
*   **[ADD] Ligue 1 Manager Integration (May 18, 2025):** Added functionality to `managers.json` processing to import and append manager data from Ligue 1 club files, expanding the manager database.
*   **[DOCS UPDATE] Tone It Down (Or Up? IDK) (May 17, 2025):** Realized the old docs sounded a bit... much. Created `tone.md` to try and get a more natural, less "AI wrote this" vibe. Rewrote the README, documentation.md, and this changelog to match. Hopefully, it sounds more like me now. Quirky but smart, that's the aim. Or at least, that's what I tell myself.
*   **[MEGA PLAYER UPDATE] Player Profiles Got Buffed! 💪 (May 17, 2025):** `players.json` got a serious overhaul. Way more detailed attributes – technical, mental, physical, GK stuff. Contract deets, birthdays, the works. Saka's dribbling is now a legit 17. Messi would be proud (if he cared, which he doesn't, he's busy being the Goat).
*   **[FIX] Bundesliga Team Count Drama (May 17, 2025):** My bad, had 20 teams in the Bundesliga. Fixed `league_ger_bundeslig.json` to the correct 18. VfL Wolfsburg is in, Köln and Darmstadt are... on a break.
*   **[ADD] Ligue 1 Clubs Added (Earlier):** Populated `league_fra_ligue1,json` (yeah, that comma in the filename is still there, on the list, I swear) with its 18 teams. More digital dudes to kick a ball.
*   **[ADD] Serie A In The House! (Earlier):** Italian Serie A clubs now in `seriea_clubs.json`. Checked, 20 teams. Molto bene.
*   **[ADD] La Liga Clubs Arrive (Earlier):** `laliga_clubs.json` (renamed from `slp_clubs.json` in my head, still need to do it for real) got its Spanish teams. Updated `league_id` to `league_laliga`. Visca El Barca!
*   **[ADD] EPL Clubs Are Go! (Earlier):** Premier League clubs are in `epl_clubs.json` (was `clubs.json`). Updated `league_id` to `league_epl`. Proper job.
*   **[ADD] `leagues.json` Got Packed! (Earlier):** `leagues.json` now has 10 leagues. Top 5 Euro leagues + their 2nd divisions. Rep, promo/relegation, history. It's a lot of JSON.
*   **[INIT] `update_players.py` Exists! (Earlier):** Started a Python script for player data. It's small now, but it'll grow.
*   **[INIT] The Beginning (Ages Ago):** The spark! Created the data folder and `initial_player_config.json` (which `players.json` evolved from). Just an idea back then.

## Version 0.9-DATA-PREP (May 17-25, 2025) - "Building the Foundation"

*   **[ADD] `gameplay.md` Created (May 18, 2025):** Added a new `gameplay.md` file to start documenting the core gameplay loop, features (planned and in dev), game modes, and future ideas. Trying to get a clearer picture of the actual game.
*   **[ADD & REFACTOR] `playing_styles.json` Evolved (May 18, 2025):**
    *   Created `d:\PROJECT\FootballSim1\data\playing_styles.json` to define various tactical approaches.
    *   Initially populated with a broad list of styles, descriptions, and text-based bonus/counter effects.
    *   Refined down to 8 core styles. `countered_by` now uses style IDs for easier linking.
    *   Significantly refactored `bonus_effects` into a structured list of objects (`attribute_modified`, `modifier_type`, `value`) for better integration with the game engine. This should make applying tactical effects much cleaner.
*   **[ADD] `managers.json` Created (May 18, 2025):**
    *   Created `d:\PROJECT\FootballSim1\data\managers.json`.
    *   Populated with unique managers extracted from `epl_clubs.json`.
    *   Added new fields: `manager_id`, `current_club_id`, `playing_style_primary`, `playing_style_secondary`, and a nested `attributes` object for future detailed coaching stats.
*   **[ADD] `traits.json` Created (May 18, 2025):**
    *   Created `d:\PROJECT\FootballSim1\data\traits.json`.
    *   Populated with 15 initial footballer traits, including `name`, `description`, `associated_positions`, `key_attributes` (for achieving the trait), and `bonus_effects` (descriptive text for now).

## [Unreleased] - 2025-05-17
### Added
- Initial player data for some EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1 clubs.
- Basic simulation engine (`elclasicosim.py`, `mancity_juve_sim.py`) with event generation.

### Changed
- **Decision made to use SQLite for storing player data instead of large JSON files. This is to improve performance, scalability, and data querying capabilities as the player database grows. Big thanks to Sandeep sir for the solid DBMS foundation that helped in making this call! Let's hope this works out!**
- Refined simulation logic to include more player-specific commentary and scenarios.

### Fixed
- Addressed various JSON formatting issues and file path problems in simulation scripts.

## [2025-05-26] Manager Data System Overhaul
- All manager attributes now use a 0–100 scale (no more 0–20).
- Added `manager_ability` field, calculated from weighted attributes and star_manager_trait (4-star always ≥80, 5-star always ≥90).
- Added `star_manager_trait` (1–5) to all managers; only a few are 5-star.
- Added `age`, `league_titles`, `ucl_titles`, `uel_titles`, `domestic_cup_titles` fields to all managers (trophy fields are counts only).
- `convert_manager_scale.py` is now idempotent and safe for repeated use.

## [2025-05-27] Simulation realism improvements
- Increased minimum Poisson lambda for goals per team to 1.1, reducing excessive clean sheets for goalkeepers.
- Lowered player match rating cap to 7.8 and increased negative randomness, resulting in a more realistic spread of top player ratings.
- Slightly reduced star performance bonus for rare high ratings.
- These changes make clean sheets rarer and top player ratings less clustered, matching real-world league stats more closely.

## What M I Doin' Next? 🤔

*   **Player Data Entry Bonanza:** This is the big one. `players.json` needs THOUSANDS of players. Send help. And snacks.
*   **Filename Fixes:** Seriously, `league_fra_ligue1,json` and the `slp_clubs.json` rename. It's bugging me now.
*   **Link 'Em Up:** Make sure `key_player_ids` in club files actually point to players. Digital string-tying.

Later, Aayush (Still coding, still slightly confused, still hyped)
