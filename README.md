# Football Simulation Project

A comprehensive football career simulation game featuring multiple European leagues with realistic player data and match simulations.

## Credits and Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from classic football management games and modern career simulations:
- **Football Manager series** by Sports Interactive - for deep tactical systems
- **Football Superstar 2** by Lazy Games Dev - for engaging career progression mechanics
- **FIFA Career Mode** - for player development concepts

Built by Aayush Acharya, CSIT student passionate about football and game development.

## What I Have Built

### Data Foundation (Complete)
- **13 European leagues** with complete data structures
- **248 clubs** across all tiers of major European football
- **6,740+ players** with detailed attributes and realistic nationality distributions
- **244 managers** with tactical preferences and career histories
- **Comprehensive match simulation engine** for multiple competition formats

### League Coverage
- **Top Tier**: EPL, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, Turkish Super Lig, Belgian Pro League, Swiss Super League
- **Second Tier**: Championship, La Liga 2, Serie B, Ligue 2, Bundesliga 2

### Simulation Capabilities
- League seasons with realistic fixture generation
- Champions League (Swiss model format)
- Europa League and Conference League
- Domestic cup competitions
- Transfer market mechanics
- Player progression systems

### Technical Implementation
- **Python backend** for all simulation logic
- **JSON data storage** with comprehensive validation systems
- **Modular architecture** supporting easy league additions
- **Data integrity verification** ensuring consistency across all files

## Current Issues and Migration Plan

### The Problem
During development, I encountered significant ID management and naming consistency issues across the simulation systems. Different modules used varying identification schemes, leading to:
- Inconsistent player and club references
- Duplicate ID conflicts
- Naming convention mismatches between files
- Complex debugging when simulations failed

### The Solution
I am migrating to **integer-based primary keys** for all entities:
- Players, clubs, leagues, and managers will use sequential integer IDs
- String-based names will become secondary attributes
- All cross-references will use these standardized integer keys
- This will eliminate ID conflicts and simplify data relationships

### Current Status
The migration process is underway and will take time to complete as it requires:
- Restructuring all existing JSON data files
- Updating simulation engines to use new ID system
- Comprehensive testing of all simulation components
- Verification of data integrity across the new structure

## Future Development Plan

### Phase 1: Data Migration (In Progress)
- Complete conversion to integer-based primary key system
- Rebuild all data files with new ID structure
- Update simulation engines for new data format
- Comprehensive testing and validation

### Phase 2: Frontend Development
- Web-based user interface for career mode gameplay
- Player management and transfer interfaces
- Match result visualization
- Career progression tracking

### Phase 3: Database Integration
- Migration from JSON to proper database system
- Enhanced performance for large datasets
- Advanced query capabilities
- Improved data relationships

Both frontend development and database integration will begin simultaneously once the ID migration is complete.

## Technical Stack

**Current:**
- Python for simulation logic
- JSON for data storage
- Modular script architecture

**Planned:**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- SQLite/PostgreSQL database
- RESTful API architecture
