# My Football Sim Thingy - Data Complete & Ready! ⚽✅

Alright, Aayush here, your friendly neighborhood CSIT student, and I'm excited to announce that the data foundation for my Football Career Sim game is now **100% complete and verified**! This has been my digital sandbox for wrestling with Python and JSON to build something truly special.

The grand vision? A web-based, local game – no internet required, just you and your burgeoning football superstar. Think of your classic career mode, but I'm aiming for less of a soul-crushing grind and more... well, *fun* and *intrigue*? I'm taking a leaf out of "Football Superstar 2" (shoutout to Lazy Games Dev), but definitely stirring in my own secret sauce. The big dream is to craft something that keeps you hooked, season after season, without that dreaded "welp, I've seen it all" feeling.

## The Grand Scheme of Things (Well, Sorta) ✨

*   Player progression that actually feels like progression.
*   Clubs and leagues that feel somewhat alive.
*   Transfers, news, the usual football world drama.
*   Basically, making it fun. Messi is the Goat, after all, gotta have some fun.

## 📁 File Naming Convention (May 2025)

All files now follow a standardized naming convention:

- **League Club Files**: `data/leagues_clubs/{league_id}_clubs.json`
- **Manager Files**: `data/managers/{league_id}_managers.json`
- **Player Directories**: `data/{league_id}_clubs_players/`
- **Player Files**: `data/{league_id}_clubs_players/club_{club_name}_players.json`

The standardization ensures:
- Consistent prefixing with canonical league IDs from leagues.json
- Elimination of duplicate files with different naming patterns
- Fixed previous inconsistencies (e.g., "bundeslig" vs "bundesliga")
- Proper organization of all data files for easier reference

This standardization was applied on May 30, 2025, using the automated script `standardize_file_naming.py`.

## 🌍 New Leagues Integration (May 2025)

**Three new European leagues have been fully integrated and verified:**

- **Turkish Süper Lig** (19 teams, 551 players, authentic Turkish names and stadiums)
- **Belgian Pro League** (16 teams, 464 players, authentic Belgian names and stadiums)
- **Swiss Super League** (12 teams, 348 players, authentic Swiss names and stadiums)

**Key features:**
- Realistic player and manager name pools for each country
- Accurate nationality distributions and club data
- All clubs have full squads (29 players each) and assigned managers
- League structures, relegation systems, and reputations match the 2024-25 season
- All data verified with enhanced scripts for consistency and realism

**Total added:** 47 clubs, 1,363 players, and corresponding managers

You can now simulate, manage, and transfer players in these new leagues alongside the original 10 major European leagues!

## Peeking In? 👋

This is mostly for my own sanity and notes. But if you're stumbling through here, feel free to look around! The data foundation is now rock-solid and ready for the next development phase.

It's a marathon, not a sprint. And we just completed a major milestone! 🏁

## Techie Bits & Key Decisions

*   **Language:** Python (because it's awesome and I know it)
*   **Current Data Format:** JSON with comprehensive validation
*   **Future Player Data Storage:** Planning SQLite migration for performance! Massive thanks to **Sandeep sir** for the invaluable DBMS lessons that guided this choice!
*   **Player Generation:** Sophisticated system with:
    * League-specific nationality distributions (e.g., EPL 60% English, Bundesliga 60% German, Serie B 85% Italian)
    * Position-based attribute templates for realistic skill distributions
    * Club reputation affecting overall player quality
    * Authentic name generation based on nationality
    * Specialized goalkeeper attributes for all keepers
*   **Data Integrity:** Multi-script validation system ensuring 100% consistency
*   **Simulation:** Custom-built engine (in development)

## Manager Data System (2025 Update)

- All manager attributes (attacking_coaching, defensive_coaching, tactical_knowledge, man_management, youth_development, adaptability) are now on a 0–100 scale.
- New field: `manager_ability` (0–100), calculated as a weighted average of the main attributes, with a minimum threshold for star_manager_trait 4 (≥80) and 5 (≥90).
- New field: `star_manager_trait` (1–5), representing manager reputation/impact. Only a few managers have 5; most are 1–3.
- New fields: `age`, `league_titles`, `ucl_titles`, `uel_titles`, `domestic_cup_titles` (all integers, trophies are counts only).
- The conversion and calculation logic is implemented in `convert_manager_scale.py` and is safe to re-run on already converted data.

## 2025-05-27: Realism Update
- Improved match simulation realism: fewer clean sheets for goalkeepers, more natural spread in top player ratings.
- Increased minimum goals per match, lowered rating cap, and added more randomness to ratings.
- Results now better match real-world league stats for both GKs and outfield players.

Later,
Aayush
